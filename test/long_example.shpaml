    p.intro
        This website itself is authored in SHPAML.  I
        preprocess SHPAML documents into templates that Django
        then renders.  Many of the pages on the site are fairly
        static in nature, but I do exercise most of Django's
        core features in my SHPAML documents, such as inheritance,
        iteration, and variable interpolation.
    p
      Most of the examples that follow are from this website, but
      the first one was contributed by another user.  (If anyone
      has examples they'd like to share, please contact the mailing
      list.)
      

    table.long_example
        tr
            th | input
            th | output

        {% for example in examples %}
            tr
                td
                    b | {{ example.fn }}.shpaml
                    pre
                        {{ example.input }}
                td
                    b | {{ example.fn }}.html
                    pre
                        {{ example.output }}
        {% endfor %}
